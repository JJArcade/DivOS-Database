This is my divinity inventory manager/builder.
It allows you to read your weapon and armor items from a .CSV file so you can view them in a sortable table and track your characters' equipment.
You can find the best combinations of armor pieces to maximize armour rating, atrributes, abilities or resistances.
You can also find the highest weapon configurations for specific damage types for a specific character.
All your armor builds can be saved and loaded so you can pick up where you left off.
